Introduction: 
The main guiding question for this project is: “How can NFL teams optimize their offensive output in the red zone?” The input variables in our study were the type of play ran, 
meaning either pass or run, and play formation. These variables were associated with the outcomes of yards gained, as well as if the play resulted in a first down or a
touchdown. Therefore, some smaller sub-questions to guide our project are: Are pass or run plays more likely to gain yards, score a touchdown, or achieve a first down
in the red zone? What formations are best for achieving these outputs in the red zone as well?The domain of this research is professional sports, and more specifically, 
American Football in the United States (NFL). The data gathered is play-by-play data from every NFL game over the past five seasons (2019-2023). These are important questions 
to answer in terms of the success of an NFL team. An offense can be efficient in gaining yards and getting to the red zone, but if they cannot score once there, their drive 
stalls out and there chance of winning decreases. The difference between scoring a touchdown in the red zone and having to settle for a field goal can be the difference 
between winning and losing many games in an NFLseason. 

Overview:
NFLRedZoneEfficiencyFinal.rmd
Analyzed both quantitative and qualitative NFL play-by-play data from 2019-2023 in R using logistic regression, random forest prediction modeling, hypothesis testing, as well 
as ANOVA and post-hoc modeling. 
Identified statistically significant variables predicting whether a play would result in a touchdown or a first down.
